Installation and Usage

Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:

Note: There is a bug in Mint with it's espeak and pulseaudio, not the app itself. However these bugs do not affect the program, and it still opperates just fine and good.

$ sudo apt-get install espeak mbrola git-core

Choose your voices. There are many, but for all english ones, do

$ sudo apt-get install mbrola-us1 mbrola-us2 mbrola-us3 mbrola-en1

$ git clone git://github.com/BullShark/JSpeak.git

$ cd JSpeak/dist

$ Java -jar JSpeak.jar

Fedora/Suse:
# yum install espeak
