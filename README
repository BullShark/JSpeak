Installation and Usage

Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:

Note: There is a bug in Mint with it's espeak and pulseaudio, not the app itself. However these bugs do not affect the program, and it still opperates just fine and good.

$ sudo apt-get install espeak mbrola git-core

Choose your voices. There are many, but for all english ones, do

$ sudo apt-get install mbrola-us1 mbrola-us2 mbrola-us3 mbrola-en1

Many mbrola voices can be installed through apt-get in Ubuntu/Mint. Some such as mbrola-mx1 are not available through apt. If you wish to install those. Follow the manual installation for them.

Fedora/Suse:
# yum install espeak git

Fedora and other rpm based systems do not have mbrola and mbrola packages afaik. However this is not a problem. Continue to follow the manual installation for them.
