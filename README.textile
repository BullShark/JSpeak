h2. Installation and Usage

h3. Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:

*Note:* There is a bug in Mint with it's espeak and pulseaudio, not the app itself. However these bugs do not affect the program, and it still opperates just fine and good.

*Note:* Do not copy and paste the *$* at the beginning of the commands or the *#*. The *$* means run as your user. The *#* means run as the root user or use sudo if on an Ubuntu/Mint box.

@$ sudo apt-get install espeak mbrola git-core@

Choose your voices. There are many, but for all english ones, do

@$ sudo apt-get install mbrola-us1 mbrola-us2 mbrola-us3 mbrola-en1@

Many mbrola voices can be installed through apt-get in Ubuntu/Mint. Some such as mbrola-mx1 are not available through apt. If you wish to install those. Follow the manual installation below for them.

h3. Fedora/Suse:

@# yum install espeak git@

Fedora and other rpm based systems do not have mbrola and mbrola packages afaik. However this is not a problem. Continue to follow the manual installation for them.

h3. Manual installation of mbrola and mbrola voices (From the espeak/mbrola docs)

<h3>Linux Installation</h3>

From eSpeak version 1.44 onwards, eSpeak calls the mbrola program directly, rather than passing phoneme data to it using a pipe.
<ol>
<li>To install the Linux Mbrola binary, download:
<a href="http://www.tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/bin/pclinux/mbr301h.zip"> http://www.tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/bin/pclinux/mbr301h.zip</a>.
Unpack the archive, and copy and rename the file from: <code>mbrola-linux-i386</code> to
<code>mbrola</code> somewhere in your executable path (eg. <code>/usr/bin/mbrola</code> ).
<p>
<li>Get the en1 voice from:
<a href="http://www.tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/mbrcopybin.html"> http://www.tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/mbrcopybin.html</a>.
Unpack the archive, and copy the "<b>en1</b>" data file (not the whole "en1"
directory) to <code>/usr/share/mbrola/en1</code>.<p>eSpeak will look for mbrola voices firstly in <code>espeak-data/mbrola</code> and then in <code>/usr/share/mbrola</code>
<p>
<li>If you use the eSpeak voice such as "<b>mb-en1</b>" then eSpeak will use the mbrola "en1" voice, eg:<br>
<code>espeak -v mb-en1 "Hello world"
</code>
</ol>
