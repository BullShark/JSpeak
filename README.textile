h2 Installation and Usage

Ubuntu/Debian/Mint:

Note: There is a bug in Mint with it's espeak and pulseaudio, not the app itself. However these bugs do not affect the program, and it still opperates just fine and good.

$ sudo apt-get install espeak mbrola git-core

Choose your voices. There are many, but for all english ones, do

$ sudo apt-get install mbrola-us1 mbrola-us2 mbrola-us3 mbrola-en1

Many mbrola voices can be installed through apt-get in Ubuntu/Mint. Some such as mbrola-mx1 are not available through apt. If you wish to install those. Follow the manual installation for them.

Fedora/Suse:
# yum install espeak git

Fedora and other rpm based systems do not have mbrola and mbrola packages afaik. However this is not a problem. Continue to follow the manual installation for them.

Manual installation of mbrola and mbrola voices (From the espeak/mbrola docs)

Linux Installation
From eSpeak version 1.44 onwards, eSpeak calls the mbrola program directly, rather than passing phoneme data to it using a pipe.

    To install the Linux Mbrola binary, download: http://www.tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/bin/pclinux/mbr301h.zip. Unpack the archive, and copy and rename the file from: mbrola-linux-i386 to mbrola somewhere in your executable path (eg. /usr/bin/mbrola ).

    Get the en1 voice from: http://www.tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/mbrcopybin.html. Unpack the archive, and copy the "en1" data file (not the whole "en1" directory) to /usr/share/mbrola/en1.

    eSpeak will look for mbrola voices firstly in espeak-data/mbrola and then in /usr/share/mbrola

    If you use the eSpeak voice such as "mb-en1" then eSpeak will use the mbrola "en1" voice, eg:
    espeak -v mb-en1 "Hello world" 

Obtaining and running the app.

$ git clone git://github.com/BullShark/JSpeak.git

$ cd JSpeak/dist

$ Java -jar JSpeak.jar
